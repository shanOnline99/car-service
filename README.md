# CarService

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.1.

Introduction
This test is designed to assess your knowledge of Angular.

Instructions
You have to use the Angular 18 to create the project.
Include linting.
Use Tailwind CSS with Sass for styling.
Include four environments: development, staging, production, and testing.
Make it responsive.
Use latest angular features.
Problem
I want to have a UI for a car service center. The UI should have the following features:

A way to add a new car.
A way to add a job for the car and a quick way to mark the status while the job is in progress.
A dashboard to show the number of cars in the service center and the number of jobs in progress with status.
Show statistics of the details you can show on the dashboard.
Use a language file to support multiple languages.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
